Owner.htm // OwnerPage process
------------------------------

The old OwnerPage process, based on a vbs script, has been replaced by a PowerShell script called OnwerPage.ps1.

To avoid making new schedules, the _Start.bat has been reused and the original one has been renamed to _Start.bat.org.

The new process still uses the Input.txt file to determine which folders need to be processed and the structure hasn't changed.

The OwnerPage.log contains the start and end time and serious errors if these occur.

The OwnerPage.ps1 is automatically updated from the \\corp.demb.com\NetLogon\SOE\OwnerPage folder every time the _Start.bat is started.
