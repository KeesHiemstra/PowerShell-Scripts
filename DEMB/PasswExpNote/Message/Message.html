<p>Dear $(Dear),</p>
<p>Your JDE Windows password will expire in $(ExpireDays) days. If you do not change your password before this date, you will not be able to log into your Windows user account.</p>
<p>Changing your JDE Windows password is easiest by locking your JDE computer (Ctrl + Alt + Del) and changing the password from there.</p>

<p>If you do not have a JDE computer, you can change your password by clicking on the settings icon on the &quot;The Cafe&quot; intranet page or by clicking <a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/ChangePassword.aspx?BrandContextID=O365&ruO365=">here</a> and go to the Profile tab to change your password.</p>

<p>If you are too late or not able to logon to Windows you can also make use of the SSPR (Self Service Password Reset) systems, more information about the JDE password resets systems can be found in the intranet.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">IMPORTANT:</span> If you also receive your email on a mobile device other than blackberry, you will need to reset the password on the device itself as well. If not, the device will try to access your email with the old password and your Windows account will get locked.</p>
